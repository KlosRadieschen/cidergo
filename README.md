# CiderGo

A convenient library for interacting with Cider's RPC.

## Introduction

> [!TIP]
> [Cider](https://cider.sh) is a client for Apple Music that works on all major operating systems.

CiderGo is designed for developers looking to build applications that control your local Cider app. This library simplifies interactions with the Cider RPC, offering programmatic control over music playback.

## Current Features

This library currently support all endpoints of /api/v1/playback (which is basically all of them).

## Installation

Install CiderGo via `go get`:

```sh
go get github.com/klosradieschen/cidergo
```

## Getting Started

Make sure that the Cider RPC client is running under Settings -> Connectivity -> Websocket API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of right now, you have to go to "Manage External Application Access to Cider" (right underneath the Websocket API setting) and ***disable API tokens***.

## Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example that retrieves the name of the currently playing song:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/klosradieschen/cidergo"
)

func main() {
    song, err := cidergo.CurrentSong()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(song.Name) // Prints the name of the currently playing song
}
```
